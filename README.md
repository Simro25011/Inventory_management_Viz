# Inventory Management Dashboard
## Overview
The Inventory Management Dashboard is a powerful tool designed to provide comprehensive insights into your inventory system. It focuses on various important metrics such as the ABC classification distribution, annual revenue distribution, current stock distribution, inventory turnover ratio distribution, weekly sales amount, and weekly demand.

ABC classification is a ranking system for identifying and grouping items in terms of how useful they are for achieving business goals but to better estimate service rates and safety stock targets, we need to add another dimension: XYZ categories.

These metrics are represented in visually appealing and understandable charts and tables to help you make informed business decisions. By understanding your inventory better, you can optimize your stock levels, streamline your supply chain, and maximize your profitability.
